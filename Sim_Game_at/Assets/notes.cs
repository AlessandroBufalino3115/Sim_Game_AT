/*



the start of an agent at least, agents dont collide with others they just glide on the map,

the council has all the power and the ddecidion making on what happens 

need a way to estimate the resource consumption

make the cycles go through the compute shader system




// with this also we need to make an NPC object
there needs to be a timer the timer is specific to the building, once the timer is called
there is going to be a loop, checks for the available workers and what resrouce is mostly needed 
this is where the prediciton is very important, for now we can have a very simple all the ages take 10 food per day

when we need something we need a range on the builindg so the radius is like 30 tiles and in those 30 tiles is going to take in all the tiles that are bushes
and then do some pathing to the send them there, once collected added 

we need a way to split jobs once things have equal priotity

need to set up a dict for the initiali costs or something for the bulding 
once the max amount of people is reached we prioritize new houses, every couriutine new person spawns?

need to find a way to tell them what building to build


i think before we worry about the which builing to spawn we need to deal with the NPC actually going out and getting basic shit done
